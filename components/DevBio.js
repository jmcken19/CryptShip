                        I&apos;m a computer science student with interests in sports, technology, leadership, and business. In university, I got into crypto and became increasingly interested in the technology behind it, especially how blockchains, wallets, and on-chain systems actually work. My experience spans network infrastructure, software, and project management, and I also lead a Division I men&apos;s volleyball club as team captain and president.
