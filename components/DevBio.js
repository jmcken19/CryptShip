                        I&apos;m a computer science student building Cryptship, a project dedicated to helping non-crypto investors get into crypto safely by learning the fundamentals of wallet setup and secure onboarding before they ever move money. After getting into crypto in university, I became interested in how blockchains actually work and noticed most beginners don&apos;t lose because of trading, but because they don&apos;t understand wallets, networks, and the safety steps that prevent irreversible mistakes. Cryptship&apos;s goal isn&apos;t to tell users what to buy—it&apos;s to help them set up and fund a wallet safely, so they can make their own decisions with confidence.
